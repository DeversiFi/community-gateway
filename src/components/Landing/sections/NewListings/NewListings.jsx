        The DeversiFi Token Vote is the process by which tokens are listed on the platform through a
        community vote.

        <br />
        We believe it is crucial that those who regularly trade on DeversiFi decide which tokens are
        available, so that our offering reflects what the community wants. Following a successful
        token proposal, potential new tokens are put up for voting and all NEC holders are issued
        with voting tokens proportional to their holdings. Accordingly, NEC holders directly
        influence which tokens are listed on the platform.

        This process is now paused, but you can find the description of the previous process here
