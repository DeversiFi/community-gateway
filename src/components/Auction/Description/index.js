        Every week the necBurn smart contract facilitates an auction the ‘necBurn’ whereby it sells
        off a percentage of the revenues gathered from trading fees on DeversiFi (in ETH) in the
        previous week in exchange for NEC tokens which then get destroyed - ‘burnt’.
      </p>

      <p className="text__secondary">
        The auctions start on Thursday of each week and last 7 days or until the accumulated funds
        are sold out. The opening NEC/ETH price of the auction is half the price at which the
        previous auction ended and it increases incrementally 5 times per day.
      </p>

      <p className="text__secondary">
        The portion of DeversiFi trading fee revenues dedicated to the auction is determined by the
        following schedule. <a target="__blank" href="https://nectar.community/whitepaper#page=17">Click

        For the purposes of the necBurn auction revenues from DeversiFi trading fees are defined as
        trading fees collected from users minus on-chain settlement costs minus external liquidity
