                Ethfinex{' '}
              </a>{' '}
              is building a hybrid trading and discussion platform for Ethereum tokens. We use the
              term hybrid because users will have the option of trading on a centralized or
              decentralized version of the platform. Market makers are incentivized to use the
              platform through Nectar tokens. The goal of the platform is to democratize the
              decision-making process required to operate a cryptocurrency exchange to our users.

            <h2>What is the Nectar token (NEC)?</h2>
            <p className="info-tip">
              The Nectar token is a crypto token created by Ethfinex. The function of the token is
              to incentivize market makers to provide liquidity on the platform, and give users a
              way to participate in democratic decision making for the future of Ethfinex. Every
              30-day period, 50% of all of the fees collected from trading activity are put into a
              smart contract pool. Those who make markets on Ethfinex receive a proportional amount
              of NEC based on their activity for the given period, and can redeem these tokens for
              the fees in the pool.

              against USD, ETH, and BTC. Market makers (customers who place limit orders onto the
              order book which are later executed) receive Nectar tokens at the end of every 30-day
              period as a reward for providing liquidity to the exchange. By adding liquidity and
              therefore creating well populated order books, aiding price discovery, these market
              makers improve the experience of trading on Ethfinex for all users, since spreads are
              reduced which in turn leads to a lower effective cost of trading. The amount of tokens
              received is proportional to the user’s 30-day trading volume.

              on coin listings. As well as functionality for submitting proposals and voting, the
              site also provides statistics, learning resources, and tools to allow the Nectar token
              holders to safely redeem their tokens for the proportional amount of Ethereum locked
              in the Nectar smart contract.

            <p className="info-tip">
              The Ethfinex Voting Token is a bi-monthly distributed token used for the voting of
              ERC20 tokens to be listed on Ethfinex. You can view the currently ongoing vote{' '}
              <Link to="/token-leaderboard"> here </Link>. These tokens are distributed to Nectar
              Token (NEC) holders every time a vote starts in a 1:1 ratio, eg. a user holding 5,000
              NEC on the date and time that the voting begins, would receive 5,000 EVT.

            <h2>Are EVTs used only for voting?</h2>
            <p className="info-tip">
              Whilst the main purpose for the Ethfinex Voting Token is for the community to vote
              which tokens will be listed, users are able to trade EVT on the platform, with the
              EVT/USD pair.

            <h2>Is EVT a long term investment token?</h2>
            <p className="info-tip">
              EVT is a terrible long term investment. The tokens expire and disappear every two
              weeks, at the end of a voting period. New EVT tokens are then distributed to NEC
              holders. The EVT market is stopped 3 hours before voting ends, to ensure plenty of
              time is left for remaining EVT tokens to be withdrawn for voting purposes.

            <p className="info-tip">
              EVT are spent when voting for one of the tokens on the list, or trading on the
              Ethfinex platform. All remaining EVT not used in voting expire at the end of the two
              week period and the EVT markets on Ethfinex are then cleared. Users will be required
              to vote or sell the EVT before expiration to avoid any loss.

            <h2>If I withdraw my EVT to an external wallet, will they still expire?</h2>
            <p className="info-tip">
              Tokens withdrawn to external wallets will also expire and balances will disappear at
              the end of the voting period. This is automatic and will expire across all Wallets.
              EVT are then reissued based on users updated NEC balances, to be used in the next
              token listing vote and when the EVT market begins again.

            <h2>If the token we are voting on does not go through, do we get the EVT back?</h2>
            <p className="info-tip">
              No, as the EVT tokens expire every 2 weeks when the voting period ends, the EVT market
              is cleared 3 hours before voting ends. Once voting ends the EVT tokens expire and new
              tokens with a new contract address are issued to NEC holders at the ratio of 1:1.

              A proposal is a submission for a change to Ethfinex and how it operates. After

              Anyone that holds Nectar tokens may submit a proposal to the platform, and can do so
              using their Ethereum wallet via Metamask, Ledger Nano S, or an Ethereum Keystore

              The proposal goes to Ethfinex administrators for review, and when accepted enters the

              Not yet, only when the governance layer goes on-chain. The on-chain governance layer
              is irreversible and we’re taking our time to get it right. For the moment proposals
              are considered advisory, to allow any users of Ethfinex and holders of Nectar tokens
              to transparently give their opinion.

              Currently there are two major categories of events where you can vote:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Token listing selection.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. Any Ethfinex improval suggestion made by the community. These can include new fee
              structures, governance methods, referral schemes, or Nectar token functionality.
              Further into the future we envision users voting on all operational decisions
              affecting the platform.

              . Along with our own review processes, community interest on the Ethfinex discussion
              forums or other social channels is also important. We feel Ethfinex should aim to be
              part of an industry wide effort to self-regulate, and so all tokens included in a
              community listing vote have already met the minimum standards required according to
              our own due diligence. Amongst other criteria, we look for original, open-source
              projects which use blockchain technology to solve a real business or societal need.

            <h2>How are token votes decided?</h2>
            <p className="info-tip">
              Every few weeks 12 tokens are to be placed up for community vote. All holders of the
              Nectar token will receive an equal number of temporary voting tokens. These are spent
              to vote for any of the tokens on the list, and can also be transferred to others who
              you wish to vote on your behalf. The 3 tokens on the list which receive the highest
              number of votes will then be listed at the end of the period. A new period will then
              begin, with redistribution of temporary voting tokens. You can see an example of the

              The goal of the discussion forums is to foster learning around new tokens, and to
              allow interest in new tokens to be evaluated from crowdsourced ratings and comments.
              Users receive a reputational rating based on the quality of information they provide.
              A higher reputational score carries more weight with respect to token ratings.
