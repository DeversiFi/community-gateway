      <p>
        <strong>BACKGROUND</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The necDAO is a next - generation decentralised autonomous organisation
          for community governance of software protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          The necDAO is built on the Smart Contract framework for decentralised
          autonomous organisations developed by DAOstack. DAOstack's Smart Contract
          framework is based on its ARC version v0.0.l -rc34 <strong> DAOstack's
          Framework </strong> ​and is to enable highly scalable organisations through efficient and
          resilient decision making in large groups. The design of the necDAO
          is an attempt to balance sufficient decentralisation of participation
          and the provision of meaningful control with regard to decision making and
          execution. The necDAO is an experiment to establish a decentralised governance
          structure without intermediaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          The purpose of the necDAO is to govern the use of the funds locked in
          the underlying Nectar Smart Contract. The intent is for these funds to
          be used to stimulate the growth decentralised products in the NEC ecosystem,
          creating value and increasing the utility of NEC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although the technical development of the necDAO is a project of the Company,
          based on DAOstack's Framework, the contribution of the Company is limited
          to providing the technical basis for the necDAO, including its one month
          initialisation phase, the ​<strong>Reputation Bootstrap Period​</strong>, which runs from
          the moment the necDAO is deployed for the next 30 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reputation may be acquired by three methods, all of which target persons
          with sufficient technical and legal expertise to contribute their industry
          knowledge to the further development of the trading protocol, and who do not act as Consumers.
        </li>
        <li>
          With the end of the Reputation Bootstrap Period 30 days after the deployment
          of the necDAO Smart Contract., the Company relinquishes all control over the necDAO.
          Following the ​<strong>Freeze Period</strong>, ​the <strong>Governance Period</strong> ​
          begins 7 days after the end of the Reputation Bootstrap Period through the activation of all
          governance powers of the necDAO, including making proposals, voting,
          predicting, and upgrading the necDAO. Following activation, the necDAO
          has full autonomy over itself and any assets it controls and is then
          governed by the initial necDAO Reputation Holders.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Parties have agreed to enter into this Agreement for the purpose of
          clarifying the exercise of their rights and obligations in relation to
          the Reputation Bootstrap Period and/or the Governance Period (as defined in clause 2).

        <br/>
        <li><strong>SCOPE OF COMPANY’S INVOLVEMENT</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The technical development of the necDAO is a project of the Company based
              on DAOstack’s Framework. The contribution of the Company is limited
              to providing the open-sourced "<strong>Foundational Code</strong>"
              ​of the necDAO, as well as the mechanism design of the initial Reputation
              distribution and the initial governance parameters.
            </li>
            <li>
              Beyond this, the Company’s involvement is limited to the provision
              of the Vote Staking Interface until the end of the Reputation Bootstrap
              Period only. The Company’s involvement is limited to the coordination
              of the Reputation Bootstrap Period until the end of the Reputation
              Bootstrap Period only.
            </li>
            <li>
              Subject to the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the Company will
              cease any remaining controls over any necDAO Smart Contract processes
              with the distribution of Reputation to the necDAO Reputation Holders.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>FUNCTIONING OF THE GOVERNANCE PERIOD</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Subject the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, in the Freeze Period
              the Company will cease any and all controls over the necDAO Smart Contracts,
              which become fully controlled by the necDAO with the start of the Governance Period.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the Governance Period, all necDAO decisions shall be taken by way of Proposal by the necDAO Reputation Holders in accordance with the governance parameters and the necDAO Schemes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Changes to the governance parameters may be made by way of Proposal within the Scheme Registrar (Admin Scheme).
            </li>
            <li>
              Proposals may be submitted by any Wallet address.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each Proposal is subject to a Prediction Challenge until it becomes a Boosted Proposal. As part of the Prediction Challenge, the necDAO automatically stakes the DAOStake against the acceptance of the Proposal. Any Holder of GEN may also stake with GEN either in favour or against a Proposal. Where a Proposal's Confidence Level exceeds the Boosting Threshold, the Proposal becomes a Pending Proposal. If at any time during the Pending Proposal Period, a Pending Proposal's Confidence Level falls below the earlier Boosting Threshold, a Pending Proposal reverts back to a Regular Proposal.
            </li>
            <li>
              A ​Pending Proposal becomes a Boosted Proposal if (1) the Pending Proposal Period has ended, (2) its Confidence Level is above the then current Boosting Threshold and (3) an External Call is made to boost it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Predictions on Boosted Proposals are not possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              A ​Boosted Proposal passes if the Boosted Proposal receives more Reputation votes in its favour than against it. A Boosted Proposal fails if the Boosted Proposal receive more Reputation votes against it than in its favour. Boosted Proposals are open for vote by necDAO Reputation Holders for the length of the Boosted Proposal Voting Period subject to the Quiet Ending Period, if any.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Regular Proposal is accepted if and when the number of Reputation votes in favour of the Proposal meets the Non-Boosted Acceptance Threshold. A Regular Proposal is rejected if and when the number of Reputation votes against the Regular Proposal meets the Non-Boosted Rejection Threshold. Regular Proposals Expire with the end of the Regular Proposal Voting Period, if they have neither been accepted nor rejected by vote​.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where within the length of the Quiet Ending Period prior to the expected end of the Boosted Proposal Voting Period, a Reputation vote changes the expected voting outcome, the Boosted Proposal Voting Period is extended such that voting on the Proposal remains open for the length of another Quiet Ending Period. This process is repeated until no decision change occurs within the respective Quiet Ending Period.
            </li>
            <li>
              To accept and reject a Boosted Proposal after the end of the voting period, a person may place an External Call for which the person is paid the External Call Reward. This External Call Reward is subtracted from the Upstake on the Boosted Proposal.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a Boosted Proposal is accepted, the total Upstake (minus the External Call Reward) together with the total Downstake will be paid to the aligned Predictors, distributed in proportion to their share of the total Upstake. Where a Boosted Proposal is rejected, the total Downstake together with the total Upstake (minus the External Call Reward) is paid to the aligned Predictors, distributed in proportion to their share of the total Downstake.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a Regular Proposal is either accepted or rejected by vote, the total GEN amount staked on the correct outcome together with the total GEN amount staked on the incorrect outcome is paid to the aligned Predictors, distributed in proportion to each Predictor's share in the total GEN staked on the correct outcome.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a Regular Proposal expires, the total Up and Downstake are returned to the respective Predictors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a Proposal is accepted, the Proposer is allocated the Proposer Reward.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where a necDAO Reputation Holder votes on a Regular Proposal or a Pending Proposal, the Pre-boost Voting Reputation Stake is subtracted at the time of voting from the necDAO Reputation Holder's Reputation. Where the necDAO Reputation Holder's vote aligned with the final voting outcome, the Pre-boost Voting Reputation Stake is returned together with a share of the Pre-boost Reputation Stakes of necDAO Reputation Holders, whose vote did not align with the final outcome, allocated pro rata to the aligned necDAO Reputation Holder's Reputation share.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>REPUTATION IS NON-TRANSFERABLE</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Reputation distributed under this Agreement to a Wallet address is person-specific and may not be transferred by law or technology to another Party or a non-Party. A transfer in this sense means the change of Reputation between two persons with legal personality. All forms of transfer are prohibited, including those that occur by technically bypassing the restrictions on-chain and those that occur by transferring or assigning the Wallet off-chain.
            </li>
            <li>
              The prohibition of clause 4.1 does not include a reallocation of Reputation by decision of the necDAO. By way of proposal, the necDAO may strip the Reputation of a necDAO Reputation Holder and may reallocate the stripped Reputation to other or new necDAO Participants.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where it becomes apparent that Reputation has been transferred to another person in violation of clause 4.1, the necDAO may by way of Proposal decide to strip the corresponding Wallet address of any or all of its Reputation.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>EXECUTION, COMMENCEMENT, AND DURATION</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              This Agreement is executed by counterparts through Digital Signature and may be Digitally Signed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed shall constitute a duplicate original, but all the counterparts shall together constitute the one Agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
              This Agreement comes into effect when a minimum of two necDAO Participants have Digitally Signed it in accordance with clause 5.1.
            </li>
            <li>
              This Agreement shall be in force until the occurrence of an Agreement Termination Event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue to be in force on or after an Agreement Termination Event (including this clause 5 and clauses 6, 8 - 14, 18 - 20, 22 - 24) shall remain in full force and effect.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>TERMINATION OF necDAO PARTICIPATION</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Prior to the Governance Period, this Agreement may not be terminated in the Reputation Bootstrap Period, except at the Company’s sole discretion.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the Governance Period:
              <ol>
                <li>A necDAO Reputation Holder ceases to be a Party to this Agreement and the necDAO, if a Proposal for expulsion (in accordance with clause 7) or resignation is submitted to the necDAO and passed successfully. Any such proposal may be submitted by the necDAO Reputation Holder to be stripped of Reputation themselves, any other Party or a non-Party.
                </li>
                <li>A ​necDAO Reputation Holder also ceases to be a Party to this Agreement and the necDAO by providing by way of Proposal proof of having irreversibly relinquished control of their Wallet address with Reputation to an ownerless address, whereby it is not required that such Proposal is accepted.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              A termination pursuant to clause 6.1 ​("<strong>Company Termination Event</strong> ") ​and clause 6.2 ("<strong>Party Termination Event</strong>") ​shall neither affect the continuance of the necDAO, nor the Agreement between the remaining Parties, nor - subject to clause 13 - any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the Parties that have accrued up to the date of such event, including the right, if any, to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Agreement which existed at or before the date of such event.
            </li>
            <li>
              Any provision of this Agreement that expressly or by implication is intended to come into or continue to be in force on or after a Company Termination Event or Party Termination Event (including this clause 6, and clauses 8 - 14, 18 - 20, 22 - 24) in relation to the respective necDAO Reputation Holder shall remain in full force and effect.

        </li>
        <li><strong>REASONS FOR TERMINATION OF PARTICIPATION</strong>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The necDAO Reputation Holders may in their sole discretion strip the Reputation from a Wallet address for cause. A cause is given, where the necDAO finds that the necDAO Reputation Holder:
              <ol>
                <li>committed any serious breach or persistent breaches of this Agreement or applicable laws; or
                </li>
                <li>is guilty of conduct which, in the opinion of the other necDAO Reputation Holders is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the necDAO.</li>

        <li><strong>GENERAL RISKS</strong>
          <p>You are fully aware of, understand and agree to assume all the risks (including direct, indirect or ancillary risks) associated with participating in the necDAO including:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The necessity for You to take Your own security measures for the Wallet used to participate to avoid a loss of access: The necDAO does not provide any central entity that can store or restore the access data of necDAO Participants. You need to keep Your private keys, seed phrases or other credentials necessary to access Your Wallet in safe custody.
            </li>
            <li>
              The immutability and irreversibility of Ethereum transactions: Errors, false inputs or other errors are solely the responsibility of each individual necDAO Participant. Neither the Company nor the other necDAO Participants shall have an obligation whatsoever to reverse or assist to reverse any false transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              The creation of more than one version of the Ethereum Blockchain due to Forks: In the event of a Fork, Your transactions may not be completed, completed partially, incorrectly completed, or substantially delayed. No Party is responsible for any loss incurred by You caused in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by a Fork of the Ethereum Blockchain.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remaining Smart Contract risks: Despite several security audits, there may be vulnerabilities in the deployed Smart Contracts: You may experience damage or loss (including financial loss) caused by the existence, identification and/or exploitation of these vulnerabilities through hacks, mining attacks (including double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks and "selfish-mining" attacks), sophisticated cyber-attacks, distributed denials of service or other security breaches, attacks or deficiencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              The potential existence of phishing websites which pretend to be the necDAO user interface due to minimal variations in spelling: It is Your obligation to carefully check that You are accessing the correct domain.
            </li>
            <li>
              The experimental status of the DAOStack’s Framework: Usage of DAOstack 's Framework has not been tested in large groups and is of experimental nature. All decisions are based on the relative or absolute majority, depending on whether a Proposal has been boosted. No distinction is made according to the subject matter of the decision and no protection is provided for minority interests.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dependencies on external data centers: Some computations may involve external data centers. You agree that We shall not be responsible for any errors or omissions by the data centers operated by third parties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Constant and dynamic regulatory developments with regard to crypto assets: Applicable laws may be uncertain and/or subject to clarification, implementation or change.
